For this there are 3 files: Math.h, Math.c and main.c.

Math.h is the header file for math.c file, it contains the C declarations and macro definitions that can be shared between several source files. Math.c contains the definition of the function math(). Math() takes three inputs, 2 integers for the operands and 1 char to determine the operator. It then selects the correct operation using a switch statement, with the operator input as the case select. For example, if operand1 = 2, operand 2 = 3, and the operator is "+" then the resultant will be 5. 

Main.c is a console application that displays the results of 5 pre determined operations: adding, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo. Lastly, it allows for the user to enter 2 operands and the operator and display the results to show the functionality of the math.c
